    </section>

    <section id="#10-cobblemon-spawn-notifications">
      <h2>#10 Cobblemon Spawn Notifications</h2>
      <li>Never miss another shiny or legendary Pokemon spawn with the Cobblemon Spawn Notifications mod</li>
      <li>This awesome mod will give you a notification anytime a shiny, legendary, mythical, or paradox pokemon spawns in your world.</li>
      <li>Definitely a must have sidemod that greatly improves quality of life, you can download it <a href="https://modrinth.com/mod/cobblemon-spawn-notification/versions">here.</a></li>
    </section>

    <section id="#9-cobblemon-fight-or-flight-mod">
      <h2>#9 Cobblemon Fight or Flight Mod</h2>
      <li>If you want a completely immersive and intense Cobblemon experience then this is the mod for you.</li>
      <li>When using the Cobblemon fight or flight mod, wild Pokemon can attack you just like in Pokemon Legends Arceus. This can add an extra layer of excitement to your Cobblemon world.</li>
      <li>Your Pokemon can also defend you from normal Minecraft mobs which is by far one of my favorite features. Download the mod <a href="https://modrinth.com/mod/cobblemon-fight-or-flight-reborn/version/ppvaJYcz">here.</a></li>
    </section>

    <section id="#8-cobblemon-mega-showdown-mod">
      <h2>#8 Cobblemon Mega Showdown Mod</h2>
      <li>By far one of the most popular Cobblemon sidemods and addons, the Mega Showdown mod adds mega evolution as well as other changes like primal reversion to Cobblemon.</li>
      <li>There's a ton of detail in all of these features so you can see more information on their <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cobblemon-mega-showdown/gallery">modrinth page.</a></li>
    </section>

    <section id="#7-cobblemon-capture-xp-mod">
      <h2>#7 Cobblemon Capture XP Mod</h2>
      <li>The Cobblemon Capture XP Mod is one of my favorite quality of life improvement mods.</li>
      <li>This mod makes it so that when you catch a Pokemon you will still gain experience as if you had knocked it out, like in the newer Pokemon games.</li>
      <li>It's a simple mod, but one I never play without. You can download it <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cobblemon-capture-xp">here.</a></li>
    </section>

    <section id="#6-xaeros-minimap">
      <h2>#6 Xaeros Minimap</h2>
      <li>If you've watched any Cobblemon videos or playthroughs on YouTube you've probably noticed a map in the corner showing all of the nearby Pokemon.</li>
      <li>This is made possible by Xaeros minimap mod, plus it's Cobblemon resource pack.</li>
      <li>Definitely one of the best addons to make your Cobblemon experience more enjoyable. You can download the mod <a href="https://modrinth.com/mod/xaeros-minimap/versions">here</a> and the resource pack <a href="https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/xaeroscobblemon">here.</a></li>
      <li>It can be a little tricky to configure the settings for this mod to get the Pokemon to show up correctly. I created a step-by-step tutorial to help with this, so feel free to check it out below if you have any questions.</li>

    </section>

    <section id="#5-cobblemon-pokenav-mod">
      <h2>#5 Cobblemon Pokenav Mod</h2>
      <li>Coming in at number 5 we have the Cobblemon Pokenav mod. This is one of my favorite mods for helping me to find rare Pokemon.</li>
      <li>The Cobblemon Pokenav mod adds the pokenav from the hoenn games as a craftable item. The pokenavs primary feature is showing you what Pokemon can spawn in your immediate area. This is super helpful when you are trying to hunt for rare Pokemon as it even shows you the exact spawn rate of all the Pokemon in your area.</li>
      <li>Click <a href="https://modrinth.com/mod/cobblemon-pokenav/versions">here</a> to download this mod.</li>
    </section>

    <section id="#4-cobblemon-rider-mod">
      <h2>#4 Cobblemon Rider Mod</h2>
      <li>Nothing is more fun than flying around on your Pokemon in Minecraft. The Cobblemon rider mod allows you to ride on your Pokemon in Cobblemon and as such is one of the best addons on the market.</li>
      <li>In the Cobblemon 1.7 update this feature will be added natively so the Cobblemon rider mod will no longer be necessary, but until then I highly recommend it. Here's the <a href="https://modrinth.com/mod/cobblemonrider1.5">link</a> to it's modrinth page so you can download it.</li>
      <li>The Cobblemon rider mod only comes with a small list of Pokemon that you can ride on, however you can change the settings to ride on any Pokemon you want, even Bidoof! Here's a simple tutorial on how to change the settings to ride on whatever Pokemon you want.</li>
      <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZBPQsKghQ4I?si=LQ0ZhEbg9kbDweji" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    </section>

    <section id="#3-cobblemon-pasture-block-collector-mod">
      <h2>#3 Cobblemon Pasture Block Collector Mod</h2>
      <li>Coming in at number 3 is one of the most OP addons of all time! The Cobblemon pasture block collector mod adds an item called the pasture collector to the game.</li>
      <li>When placed next to a pasture block this item will passively farm items from the loot tables of whatever Pokemon is in the pasture block. This essentially allows you to farm any item in the game.</li>
      <li>Definitely one of the best addons you can have for getting materials easily. Click <a href="https://modrinth.com/mod/cobblemon-pasturecollector">here</a> to download it.</li>

    <section id="#2-cobblemon-all-the-mons-mod">
      <h2>#2 Cobblemon All The Mons Mod</h2>
      <li>There are a lot of mods out there that add missing Pokemon into Cobblemon, but in my opinion none of them do it better than all the mons. Although technically it is a resource and data pack rather than a mod.</li>
      <li>As its name suggests, this mod attempts to add every Pokemon to Cobblemon that isn't yet available in the vanilla version. There are still some missing Pokemon, but they pretty much have every legendary, mythical, and paradox Pokemon added.</li>
      <li>The mod also has a very active discord to help you find these Pokemon in your game. Click <a href="https://modrinth.com/datapack/allthemons">here</a> to download the mod.</li>

    </section>

    <section id="#1-cobblemon-radical-red-mod">
      <h2>#1 Cobblemon Radical Red Mod</h2>
      <li>In my optinion the best and most essential Cobblemon addon of all time has to be the Radical Cobblemon Trainers Mod.</li>
      <li>This mod adds npc trainers and gym leaders to Cobblemon. It also adds a story mod allowing you to progress through the game like a normal Pokemon game.</li>
      <li>This mod solves Cobblemons biggest issue which is a lack of story. I highly recommend this mod to everyone especially if you're feeling bored in your Cobblemon playthrough. You can download this mod by clicking this <a href="https://modrinth.com/mod/rctmod">link</a></li>
      <li>This mod can be a little tricky to learn at first, so I made a full tutorial teaching everything you need to know about this mod. You can watch that tutorial below if you are interested.</li>
